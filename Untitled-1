expo has its own storage goodies
- securestore
- expo-sqlite
- async-storage 

otherwise


ionic4 works with any js framework, including react

RN:
- hybrid native 
- React Native, along with Xamarin and NativeScript, allows you to program your user interfaces (UI) in one language that then orchestrates native UI controls at runtime.

React Native component that renders text on a mobile app will be translated into two separate components: [TextView] for Android and [UIView] for iOS

JS code orchistrates native code through predefined interfaces. Anything Native is possible, but some stuff is pretty hard and requires actual native code to be written




Ionic: 
- hybrid web
- webview
- works well with electron
- complete control over ui looks
    - design consistency
- Modern web standards
    - can run as a pwa easily 
    - whatever you write today will keep working
