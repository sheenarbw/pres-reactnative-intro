ionic with React seems to do everything that ReactNative does but:
Size:
6.12 versus 47Mb
easy to debug
easier to share code
JIT compilation works in ios and android (instead of just android) 
just run ionic in a browser so you can debug easily with familiar tools


Can't use Cordova with React


 Ionic and React Native as two of the most common alternative


 React shop, choose React Native; if youâ€™re an Angular shop, choose Ionic 

 build a real native UI using mostly JavaScript

 Ionic gui elements=> suuuuper portable.
 - web
 - pwa
 - electron
 - android and apple

 open web standards supported in all modern browser

 lose to the metal with Native SDKs
